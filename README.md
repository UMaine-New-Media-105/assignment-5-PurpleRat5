Assignment 5 for NMD 105, this is the last assignement of the semester and as such it tests our usage of shapes, loops, conditionals, classes, functions and more.
Each of the tasks build upon each other in order to create a simulation game where breeders must try and brreed with each other and catchers must try to catch the breeders or else they will die. 
The first two tasks tested our use of classes to create bubbles that shook on a canvas, we then used thsi idea of classes to create the sim game.
